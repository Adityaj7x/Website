        <div class="mainparagraph">
            <p>Justice League is a 2017 American superhero film based on the DC Comics superhero team of the same name.
                Produced by RatPac-Dune Entertainment,DC Films, Atlas Entertainment, and Cruel and Unusual Films and
                distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is the fifth installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and
                the
                follow-up to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Directed by Zack Snyder and written by Chris
                Terrio and Joss Whedon, the film features an ensemble cast including Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy
                Adams,
                Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, J. K.
                Simmons,
                and Ciarán Hinds. In the film, Batman and Wonder Woman recruit The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg after the
                death of Superman to save the world from the catastrophic threat of Steppenwolf and his army of
                Parademons.
            </p>

            <p>Warner Bros. began to develop a live-action Justice League film in 2007 with George Miller set to direct,
                but
                the project was canceled due to production delays and budgetary concerns. A Justice League film would
                re-enter development as part of Warner Bros' upcoming DC film slate in October 2014, with Snyder on
                board to
                direct and Terrio attached to write the script. Principal photography took place from April to October
                2016.
                After Snyder stepped down from the film following the death of his daughter, Whedon was hired to oversee
                the
                remainder of post-production, including writing and directing additional scenes, as well as reshooting a
                large portion of the film, which changed many aspects of it; Snyder ultimately retained sole credit as
                director. With an estimated production budget of $300 million, Justice League is one of the most
                expensive
                films ever made.</p>

            <p>Justice League premiered in Los Angeles on November 13, 2017, and was released in the United States on
                November 17, 2017. The film grossed over $657 million worldwide against a break-even point of $750
                million,
                becoming a box office bomb and losing Warner Bros. Pictures an estimated $60 million. It received mixed
                reviews from critics, who praised the action sequences and cast performances but criticized the plot,
                pacing, and computer-generated imagery. Whedon's direction was also criticized, and the film's tone was
                met
                with a polarized response, with some appreciating the brighter tone compared to previous DCEU films and
                others finding it inconsistent and unnatural. In the wake of its release, fans began to push for the
                release
                of Snyder's original version of the film; Warner Bros. decided to move forward with the project in
                February
                2020. It was released as Zack Snyder's Justice League on HBO Max on March 18, 2021.</p>

    <h2>Superman</h2>
    <div class="heroidentity">
        <img src="img/superman.png" alt="superman" class="imagewayne">
        <p>Superman was born on the fictional planet Krypton and was named Kal-El. As a baby, his parents sent him to
            Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. His ship landed in
            the American countryside, near the fictional town of Smallville. He was found and adopted by farmers
            Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark developed various superhuman abilities, such as
            incredible strength and impervious skin. His adoptive parents advised him to use his abilities for the
            benefit of humanity, and he decided to fight crime. To protect his personal life, he changes into a colorful
            costume and uses the alias "Superman" when fighting crime. Clark resides in the fictional American city of
            Metropolis, where he works as a journalist for the Daily Planet. Superman's supporting characters include
            his love interest and fellow journalist Lois Lane, Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen and editor-in-chief
            Perry White, and his arch-enemy Lex Luthor.</p>
    </div>


    <h2>Aquaman</h2>
    <div class="heroidentity">
        <img src="img/aquaman.png" alt="aquaman" class="imagewayne">
        <p>Aquaman is a 2018 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character of the same name. Co-produced by
            Warner Bros. Pictures, DC Films and Peter Safran Productions, and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it
            is the sixth film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The film was directed by James Wan, from a screenplay
            by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall. It stars Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry / Aquaman, who sets
            out to lead the underwater kingdom of Atlantis and stop his half-brother, King Orm, from uniting the seven
            underwater kingdoms to destroy the surface world. Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Dolph Lundgren,
            Ludi Lin, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Temuera Morrison, and Nicole Kidman appear in supporting roles. Development
            began in 2004 but did not gain traction until Man of Steel was released in 2013. In August 2014, Beall and
            Kurt Johnstad were hired to write competing scripts. Wan signed on as director in April 2015, and in July
            2016, the film moved forward with Beall's screenplay.</p>

    <h2>Green Lantern</h2>
    <div class="heroidentity">
        <img src="img/green lantern.png" alt="green lantern" class="imagewayne">
        <p>Green Lantern is a 2011 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character of the same name. The film
            stars Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Peter Sarsgaard, Mark Strong, Angela Bassett, and Tim Robbins, with
            Martin Campbell directing a script by Greg Berlanti and comic book writers Michael Green and Marc
            Guggenheim, which was subsequently rewritten by Michael Goldenberg.[4] This was the first DC film since
            Catwoman not to be involved with Legendary Pictures. The film tells the story of Hal Jordan, a test pilot
            who is selected to become the first human member of an intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern
            Corps. Hal is given a ring that grants him superpowers, and must confront Parallax, who threatens to upset
            the balance of power in the universe. The film first entered development in 1997; progress remained stalled
            until Greg Berlanti was hired to write and direct in October 2007. Martin Campbell was brought on board in
            February 2009 after Berlanti was forced to vacate the director's position.</p>

    <h2>Cyborg</h2>
    <div class="heroidentity">
        <img src="img/cyborg.png" alt="cyborg" class="imagewayne">
        <p>Cyborg Superman, also known as "The Cyborg" is an evil counterpart to Superman with a robotic body designed
            using Kryptonian technology and genetics. Blaming Superman for the death of his wife, Terri Henshaw, he has
            sworn revenge and even impersonated the Kryptonian during Reign of the Supermen!. In his capacity as
            Grandmaster, he also acts as an antagonist to Green Lantern and the Green Lantern Corps. Henshaw's greatest
            wish is to die, although due to his physiology this might be impossible. He has been a member of the Alpha
            Lantern Corps, the Manhunters, the Sinestro Corps and the Suicide Squad. In the New 52 continuity reboot,
            Cyborg Superman was Supergirl's father Zor-El for a while until Hank Henshaw -previously a regular
            scientist- became Cyborg Superman again. Cyborg Superman was created by Dan Jurgens, first appearing in
            Adventures of Superman #500. </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Batman</h2>
    <div class="heroidentity">
        <img src="img/wayne.PNG" alt="bruce wayne" class="imagewayne">
        <p>Batman is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created
            by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics
            on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American
            playboy, philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features him
            swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha, a
            vendetta tempered with the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a
            bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied
            Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies Alfred Pennyworth,
            James Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy the
            Joker.</p>

    <h2>Flash</h2>

    <h2>Wonder Woman</h2>
    <div class="heroidentity">
        <img src="img/wonder woman.png" alt="wonder women" class="imagewayne">
        <p>Wonder Woman's Bronze Age origin story relates that she was sculpted from clay by her mother Queen Hippolyta
            and was given a life as an Amazon, along with superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek gods. In 2011, DC
            changed her background with the retcon that she is the biological daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, jointly
            raised by her mother and her aunts Antiope and Menalippe. The character has changed in depiction over the
            decades, including briefly losing her powers entirely in the late 1960s; by the 1980s, artist George Perez
            gave her an athletic look and emphasized her Amazonian heritage. She possesses an arsenal of magical items,
            including the Lasso of Truth, a pair of indestructible bracelets, a tiara which serves as a projectile, and,
            in older stories, a range of devices based on Amazon technology.</p>
